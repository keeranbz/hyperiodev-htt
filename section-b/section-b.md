# Section B

The project I a most proud of is my small game I made but it no longer builds.
<br>
So the project I am now most proud of is the chat app I created with my classmates for school. 
See [UDP Chat App](https://github.com/keeranbz/udp-client-server-chat-app).
<br><br>
The project runs a local UDP server and implements a simplified chat protocol
for local hosts only.<br>
I mostly worked on the server backend and the creation of our protocol.<br>

I am proud of this project because it showed me what it takes to actually build something.
